# SQL-Case-Study-on-Rotten-Tomatoes-dataset
**Introduction**

This repository contains a SQL case study focusing on a movie dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset provides detailed information about movies, including various metrics on critic and audience ratings.



**About Dataset**

*Context*

Movies' data is stored on several popular websites, but when it comes to critic reviews there is no better place than Rotten Tomatoes. This website allows to compare the ratings given by regular users (audience score) and the ratings given/reviews provided by critics (tomatometer) who are certified members of various writing guilds or film critic-associations.

Content
In the movies dataset each record represents a movie available on Rotten Tomatoes, with the URL used for the scraping, movie tile, description, genres, duration, director, actors, users' ratings, and critics' ratings.
In the critics dataset each record represents a critic review published on Rotten Tomatoes, with the URL used for the scraping, critic name, review publication, date, score, and content.
